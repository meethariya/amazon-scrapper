# amazon-scrapper
This python file will search for product details for a specific product
amazon.py is the main file to be run whereas automator.py will perform the selenium task of opening the amazon.com and search for the entered product.
Since the CSS code for results of products which are organized in other than 3 columns are differnt than the one's organised in 3 columns, this program is created under consideration of a 3 column product, it might show null values for many entries.
Hope this helps, Have a good day!
